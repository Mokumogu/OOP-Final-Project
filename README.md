**I.PROJECT OVERVIEW**


  The Motorcycle Rental Management System is a Java-based console application designed to streamline the process of renting motorcycles. It features a user-friendly interface that allows users to log in, register, rent motorcycles, and return them with ease. The system includes a user authentication module where new users can register, and existing users can securely log in. Motorcycle inventory is managed dynamically, tracking the availability of various motorcycle types such as Honda, Yamaha, and Suzuki. Users can rent motorcycles by specifying the type and rental duration, with the system validating inputs to ensure smooth operation. Upon return, the inventory is updated automatically. The application starts with a user agreement, ensuring customers understand the terms and conditions. Rentals and returns are tracked using in-memory data structures like HashMap, which store user details, active rentals, and inventory data. To improve usability, the system provides error handling for invalid inputs, duplicate usernames, and attempts to return non-rented motorcycles. Future enhancements include implementing password hashing for better security, adding data persistence through databases or file storage, and expanding features such as fine calculations, rental costing, and rental history tracking. With its simple and efficient design, the system is ideal for small to medium-scale motorcycle rental businesses looking for a lightweight and functional solution.
